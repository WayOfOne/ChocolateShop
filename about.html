             <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p> See's Candies has been making quality chocolate and candy Mary See's way for over 90 years. From the beginning, Mary took pride in her recipes and insisted on only the finest, freshest ingredients. Today, we're still just as committed to making candy the right way. 

See's has expanded from one chocolate shop to over 200 shops across America and a flourishing online store. And though we continue to grow, our commitment to tradition, taste, service and quality never wavers. 

Stop into one of our iconic black-and-white shops inspired by Mary's kitchen, or visit us online. You'll find over 100 varieties of delicious candy, chocolates, and seasonal gifts made with the same motto in mind: quality without compromise*.</p>
